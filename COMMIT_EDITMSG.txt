feat: Implement category management and user profile/password features

This commit introduces several new functionalities:

- **Category Management:**
  - Added `CategoryRepository` for data persistence.
  - Implemented `CategoryService` for business logic (CRUD operations).
  - Created `CategoryController` to expose REST endpoints.
  - Modified `Category` entity to associate categories with specific users.

- **User Profile Management:**
  - Updated `UserDTO` to remove sensitive information and align with project style.
  - Enhanced `UserService` with methods to retrieve and update authenticated user profiles.
  - Modified `UserController` to provide endpoints for viewing and editing user profiles (`/api/users/me`).

- **Password Change:**
  - Introduced `ChangePasswordDTO` for secure password update requests.
  - Added `changePassword` method to `UserService` for authenticated users.
  - Implemented a REST endpoint in `UserController` for password changes (`/api/users/change-password`).

- **Documentation:**
  - Updated `README.md` to reflect the completion of Category Management and User Profile/Password features.
