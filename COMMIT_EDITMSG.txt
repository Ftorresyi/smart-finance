feat: Implement basic reporting and analytics features

This commit introduces the initial reporting and analytics functionalities:

- **Summary of Income vs. Expenses:**
  - Created `SummaryReportDTO` to encapsulate income, expenses, and net balance.
  - Added `getSummaryReport` method to `ReportService` to calculate these values for a given period.
  - Exposed a REST endpoint (`/api/reports/summary`) in `ReportController`.

- **Spending by Category:**
  - Created `CategorySpendingDTO` to represent spending per category.
  - Added `getSpendingByCategory` method to `ReportService` to aggregate expenses by category for a given period.
  - Exposed a REST endpoint (`/api/reports/spending-by-category`) in `ReportController`.

- **Data Access Layer:**
  - Added `findByUserAndDateBetween` method to `TransactionRepository` to support date-range filtering for reports.

- **Documentation:**
  - Updated `README.md` to reflect the completion of these reporting features.
